## Challenge 1
The first challenge consisted of time-series classification on the [Pirate Pain Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raulagolli/the-pirate-pain-dataset). We ranked **1st** on the public leaderboard and **6th** on the private leaderboard out of 193 teams. Thanks to these results, our final score was **5/5**.

## Challenge 2
The second challenge consisted of image classification on a modified version of the [Grumpy Doctors Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreacallari/grumpy-doctors-v2), which featured damaged artifacts mixed with standard ones. We ranked **39th** out of 193 teams on the joint leaderboard. Thanks to this result and our non-conventional solution, our final score was **5/5**, plus a **0.5** bonus.
